Description: Software Center for GNOME
 Software lets you install and update applications and system extensions.
 .
 Software uses a plugin architecture to separate the frontend from the
 technologies that are used underneath. Currently, a PackageKit plugin provides
 data from a number of traditional packaging systems, such as rpm or apt. An
 appdata plugin provides additional metadata from locally installed data in the
 appdata format.
